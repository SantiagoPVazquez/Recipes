# Recipes
This is a Hyperskill project where you can store recipes into a PostgreSQL database and retrieve the information. 
It also implements Sping Security for authentication and authorization of users to access the application.
All users have access to the recipes list, but only users who created the recipes are allowed to update or delete the recipe.
